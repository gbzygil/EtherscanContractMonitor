# Live Etherscan Contract Monitor
1. Monitor's Etherscan verified contracts
2. Performs rug-pull possibility check on the contract
3. Extract any social media links from the contract code
4. If liquidity not added yet, checks how many ETH the developer has
5. Checks how many transactions the contract has made (some sneaky dev's re-add liquidity to trap)
